This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App];

My first web application!

Started as a final project of the "Build Frontend Apps from Scratch" course I took over at www.codecademy.com and refined with the help and supervision of @sergelerner.

This app connects with Spotify's API, lets you search for tracks, make playlists and save them at your personal profile over at spotify.com.

Enjoy Jammming :)
